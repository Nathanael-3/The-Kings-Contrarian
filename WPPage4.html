        <b>An anti affirmative action protestor in front of the US Supreme Court building</b>
        </p>
        <p id="author">
            <b>By: Saket Mistri | University of Oxford</b>
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            In the US, since Regents of the University of California v. Bakke in 1978 the use of race-based affirmative <br id="br">
            action was permitted, under the presumption that universities with students from diverse racial backgrounds, <br id="br">
            encourages diversity of thought and thus improves educational experience. This was the first time that the <br id="br">
            word ‘diversity’ came to replace the word discrimination. 
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            Since then, the word diversity has spread to the corporate sector, NGO’s, governments, and the UN. The word <br id="br">
            has gained so much traction that it is increasingly difficult to find a university or business that doesn’t <br id="br">
            tout their diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and statistics. The argument being that a <br id="br">
            diversity of races, genders, sexualities etc. create an environment that is inclusive to diversity of thought <br id="br">
            and this diversity of thought benefits educational outcomes, profit, political outcomes etc.
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            Yet, is any of this true or are these companies and institutions simply advancing ideological objectives? 
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            Not that much research has actually been done on this subject and what research there is, is often associated <br id="br">
            with partisan groups who are already heavily in favour of DEI and affirmative action for reasons other than <br id="br">
            diversity of thought and seek to legitimise the practice further, by mentioning a perceived additional benefit. <br id="br">
            Instead, from my own experience and the experience of my peers, as well as the situation that is occurring <br id="br">
            on university campuses and businesses across the Anglosphere, it seems that DEI and affirmative action initiatives <br id="br">
            are having the opposite effect to creating a diversity of thought. 
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            <a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/note-unjust-firing-dr-tabia-lee">Professors have been fired for voicing their opinion</a>, <a href="https://www.cspicenter.com/p/academic-freedom-in-crisis-punishment">employees have been silenced</a>, and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ruy-teixeira-gets-political-asylum-american-enterprise-institute-center-for-american-progress-robert-doar-11657919700">researchers stifled.</a> <br id="br">
            If a movement is attempting to silence any criticism, it is highly unlikely that it promotes a diversity of thought. <br id="br">
            In fact, a group of <a href="https://journalofcontroversialideas.org/article/3/1/236">natural scientists (including two Nobel laureates)</a> and various <a href="https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/prohibit-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-statements/">research studies by major think <br id="br">
            tanks</a> have both found that there is an inverse link between DEI and diversity of thought, typically because those <br id="br">
            who support DEI and benefit from it share a very similar worldview. 
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            This worldview believes group disparity equates to group discrimination and thus group discrimination is necessary <br id="br">
            to correct group disparity. Given that criticism of the movement comes with a steep cost and those who advance <br id="br">
            DEI tend to share a similar progressive worldview, it instead creates a culture of groupthink that is openly <br id="br">
            antagonistic to diversity of thought. In practice, it acts in a very similar way to Herbert Marcuse’s idea of <br id="br">
            liberating tolerance. 
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            In fact, it is this belief in group disparity and the need for group discrimination that is the actual driving <br id="br">
            force behind affirmative action and DEI initiatives, whilst diversity of thought is merely used a nice sounding <br id="br">
            placeholder.  The argument for diversity of thought breaks down rather quickly upon the realisation that skin <br id="br">
            pigment has no relation to cognitive capabilities, and thus whilst white people have a wide array of diverging <br id="br">
            opinions on many different issues and are not one monolith, the same can be said for black people and other races. <br id="br">
            Instead, the current cultural milieu punishes companies or individuals who do not partake in this group <br id="br">
            discrimination and those who are most fervently pushing for these measures often overcome the lacklustre pushback <br id="br">
            of those who are apolitical or socially liberal.
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            As Justice Thomas states in his concurring opinion on Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard “Harvard and UNC <br id="br">
            ask us to blind ourselves to the burdens imposed on the millions of innocent applicants denied admission because <br id="br">
            of their membership in a currently disfavoured race.” Thus diversity becomes divvying up individuals by immutable <br id="br">
            characteristics, equity becomes discrimination against innocent individuals by dint of their membership to an <br id="br">
            unfavourable identity group, and inclusion becomes silence all that oppose this programme. It’s a clever use of <br id="br">
            positive language to hide insidious motives, reminiscent of something you might find in Nineteen Eighty-Four. 
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            That being said I don’t believe the majority of those who support these initiatives are acting insidiously, <br id="br">
            instead it is more likely coming from a place of compassion or ignorance. The use of words that we deem positive <br id="br">
            like ‘inclusion’ and ‘diversity’ mean those who are less politically interested or aware think of these <br id="br">
            initiatives in a positive light, especially when partnered with phrases like ‘we just want everyone to feel <br id="br">
            included.’ However, the end of affirmative action in the US will mean that companies and institutions will have <br id="br">
            to reconsider their use of DEI initiatives, potentially allowing for a deeper discussion on its stated purposes. <br id="br">
            Yet, in the UK these initiatives are anything but on there way out. This Conservative government has done little <br id="br">
            to counter this worrying trend, even after state institutions like the RAF placed a pause on hiring white males <br id="br">
            and almost every company makes a conscious effort to achieve racial and gender parity through discrimination <br id="br">
            (both illegal practices). 
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            Yet outside of merely their illegality, these initiatives will make UK firms perform worse than their American <br id="br">
            counterparts, due to the fact that hiring based on meritocratic principles allows firms to employ from a wider <br id="br">
            talent pool, hire more productive and more talented workers, avoid the needless politicisation of their companies,<br id="br">
            and lower their costs by disbanding their DEI programs and firing the people working on them. At a time when the <br id="br">
            UK economy is performing badly, ensuring businesses are running as efficiently as possible is in the interest of <br id="br">
            the UK government.
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/businessreview/2023/07/10/the-end-of-affirmative-action-will-hurt-business/">Whilst universities like LSE</a> have already been quick to lament the end of affirmative action and its consequences  <br id="br">
            for business, any litigation brought against a company in the US is unfortunately unlikely to significantly effect  <br id="br">
            DEI initiatives in the UK and thus UK business practices are unlikely to impacted at all. 
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            Those arguing for a continuation of these programs, I would take heed of the warning of Justice Thomas when he  <br id="br">
            argues “I would have thought that history had by now taught a “greater humility” when attempting to “distinguish  <br id="br">
            good from harmful uses of racial criteria.” From the Black Codes, to discriminatory and destructive social welfare  <br id="br">
            programs, to discrimination by individual government actors, bigotry has reared its ugly head time and again. Anyone  <br id="br">
            who today thinks that some form of racial discrimination will prove “helpful” should thus tread cautiously, lest  <br id="br">
            racial discriminators succeed (as they once did) in using such language to disguise more invidious motives. Arguments  <br id="br">
            for the benefits of race-based solutions have proved pernicious in segregationist circles. Segregated universities  <br id="br">
            once argued that race-based discrimination was needed “to preserve harmony and peace and at the same time furnish  <br id="br">
            equal education to both groups.”
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            It is high time for the UK to reflect on this landmark decision across the pond and act to prevent the widespread <br id="br">
            practice of discrimination by immutable characteristics. It is of the upmost importance that the UK remain committed <br id="br">
            to meritocracy, equality and freedom to all, as the great classical liberal thinkers who occupied this island <br id="br">
            championed for, let their legacy not go to waste.
