        <p id="author">
            <b>By: Stephen Pina | University of St Andrews</b>
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            With median waiting times at thirteen weeks and increasingly common horror stories of those with serious <br id="br">
            illnesses having to wait months or even years for treatment, it is evident that the NHS is in need of reform. 
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            This stark reality was on full display during the Covid-19 pandemic, where Britain was forced to lockdown <br id="br">
            in an attempt to prevent the inevitable overrun of the NHS, causing many to lose their jobs, commit suicide <br id="br">
            and for the government to spend £70 billion that it didn’t have on a furlough scheme. 
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            Now it is the case that many of the poorest in the UK have to opt for private healthcare, paid for through <br id="br">
             crowdfunding campaigns, in order to get their necessary treatment in time. Yet the prevailing sentiment remains <br id="br">
             resistant to large-scale reform, insisting any issue is a result of chronic underfunding or that privatisation <br id="br">
             will result in millions of Brits losing access to healthcare; neither could be further from the truth. 
            
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            Firstly, the UK spends around 10% of its GDP on healthcare, roughly equal to the Netherlands and more than Denmark, <br id="br">
            Australia, Finland, New Zealand, Italy and South Korea (all of which provide their citizens with better health <br id="br">
            outcomes than the NHS). Only 10 countries in the OECD spend more on their healthcare, and with the exception <br id="br">
            of the US, all are within 1.5% of the UK. Secondly, the NHS budget has increased by roughly £55 billion since <br id="br">
            2011, whilst patient outcomes, waiting times and the average length of GP appointments have all got worse, <br id="br">
            indicating we are getting less quality for more money. 
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            Furthermore, a recent study conducted by The King’s Fund found that there is no evidence of widespread privatisation <br id="br">
            in the NHS, despite persistent claims to the contrary. Those who insist the NHS is on the path to becoming a <br id="br">
            US healthcare model are acting in bad faith, by presenting a fallacious argument where the sole privatised <br id="br">
            health system example is the US, and the NHS is presented as some sort of utopian counter. Yet, whilst the <br id="br">
            US does not have universal coverage, their health outcomes still outperform the UK and thus the challenge becomes <br id="br">
            creating a health system that is universal, high quality, and affordable. 
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            The Euro Health Consumer Index ranks Switzerland and the Netherlands as the two best healthcare systems in Europe, <br id="br">
            with the UK in 16th. Furthermore, when calculating the average OECD rankings of a group of ten nations, <br id="br">
            (South Korea, Switzerland, Australia, Italy, New Zealand, Finland, the Netherlands, Denmark, the US and the UK) <br id="br">
            for a range of factors like cancer survival rates, infant mortality, life expectancy, and outcome of cardiovascular <br id="br">
            disease care, the top three nations are South Korea, Switzerland and Australia, the Netherlands is fifth and the UK <br id="br">
            finishes dead last. 
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            Switzerland, the Netherlands and South Korea all operate universal, cost-effective and quality healthcare that is <br id="br">
            primarily privatised, whilst Australia maintains a public-private health system. The Swiss and Dutch systems work <br id="br">
            through mandatory private insurance for all citizens and for those who cannot afford, subsidised insurance from the <br id="br">
            government. The government also regulates insurance providers, thus preventing price hikes, discrimination and poor <br id="br">
            quality control. 
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            This allows for the efficiency, innovation and quality created by the private sector and the universality and <br id="br">
            affordability guaranteed by some state intervention. A common-sense middle ground is therefore clearly possible, <br id="br">
            where quality healthcare is provided without the catastrophised scenario of millions of Brits losing access to <br id="br">
            healthcare.  
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            A further hindrance is the fact that the UK does a terrible job of retaining its top medicine graduates or encouraging <br id="br"> 
            its own population to go into medicine, as most either opt to go overseas for more lucrative salaries upon graduation <br id="br">
            or decide to study a subject with more lucrative job prospects. In fact, whilst in the Netherlands only about 3% of <br id="br">
            doctors are from overseas; in the UK that figure is almost 30% to meet the domestic shortage.
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            By privatising the healthcare sector, the UK can benefit from better doctors and more doctors, decreasing waiting <br id="br">
            times and increasing health outcomes. As the NHS continues to lag behind its OECD peers, the case for its privatisation <br id="br">
             has never been stronger.
