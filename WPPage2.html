        <b>Late Queen Elizabeth II walking with King Charles III</b>
        </p>
        <p id="author">
            <b>By: Henri Rossano | Durham University | 13/10/2023</b>
        </p>
        <div class="article">
        <p>
            A few weeks ago, we commemorated one year since the death of Queen Elizabeth II and King Charles III’s <br id="br">
            accession to the throne. This commemoration was juxtaposed with the release of a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-66707923">YouGov opinion poll</a>, <br id="br">
            which showed that, among 18 to 24-year-olds, only 30% say that monarchy is “good for Britain”, compared <br id="br">
            with 77% among over 65s. Although young people often change their opinions over time, this sharp <br id="br">
            generational divide should ring, if not the death knell of British monarchy, then at least alarms bells <br id="br">
            among its defenders. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Christians and religious people generally should see this as a potential threat, as republics do not have <br id="br">
            a good track record when it comes to being friendly to religious practice. But, to give the devil his due, <br id="br">
            perhaps a certain scepticism towards monarchy is warranted. After all, monarchs throughout history have not <br id="br">
            always been of the same ilk as that of our late queen or even of our current king. As a Telegraph article put <br id="br">
            it, the role has been filled by “two foreigners, a rake and a madman”. Some monarchs, who claimed to have <br id="br">
            acceded to the throne by divine appointment, have turned out to be tyrannical towards their subjects, a <br id="br">
            seemingly incompatible combination. What’s more, kings and queens in Christendom often accorded themselves <br id="br">
            powerful positions within the Church and posed as strong defenders of faith, all the while engaging in bitter <br id="br">
            and divisive conflicts with the Church. For instance, Philip IV, who as French king used the legitimist title <br id="br">
            of Rex Christianissimus, fought with Pope Boniface VIII over the right to appoint bishops, among other things, <br id="br">
            and ended up sending armed troops to depose him. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The conflict between monarchs’ behaviour and their stated Christianity puts into question the practice of <br id="br">
            raising them to such heights. Is it God’s intention that human societies should organise themselves in such <br id="br">
            a way? After all, did God not express to the Prophet Samuel His disappointment with the people of Israel’s <br id="br">
            decision to replace Him with a king? And yet, it is my firm belief that informed reason and moral sense point<br id="br">
            towards monarchy, more specifically British-style monarchy, as the most legitimate form of political system. <br id="br">
            Although the Christian pre-suppositions involved in this approach may seem narrow-minded, they offer an insight<br id="br">
            into the deep and indispensable meaning implied in monarchy, and are thus accessible for all. 
        </p>
            <h2 style="font-size: medium; font-family: century schoolbook; text-align: left;"><u><b>The need for hierarchy</u></b></h2>
        <p>
            To a certain extent, monarchic structures come naturally to human societies. This is partly inscribed in human <br id="br">
            biology, with extensive research demonstrating our biological ancestors’ proclivity for hierarchical organisation. <br id="br">
            But this is also borne out historically, where most early societies - meaning generally societies from <br id="br">
            pre-civilisational tribal units, through to the Sumerians and the establishment of the first civilisations, <br id="br">
            up to approximately the fourth century B.C. - coalesced around single leaders. Even the Greek and Roman republics <br id="br">
            that followed had the tendency to revert to a system where one man controlled the reins of power, often with <br id="br">
            populist and dictatorial (in the modern sense of the word) characteristics, such as Pericles and Caesar. There <br id="br">
            are of course exceptions and nuances to this broad-brush overview of human history, but by and large it remains <br id="br">
            true that less complex and developed societies, that is to say societies that are closer to a ‘state of nature’,<br id="br">
            structure themselves along single-headed hierarchical lines. This makes sense if one is to consider the fact <br id="br">
            that societies in the past faced many more existential crises, much more often than modern societies do. Beyond <br id="br">
            the need for someone to fill executive functions and to have a unified foreign policy, it was also a necessity <br id="br">
            to have a quick and absolute response to war or plague.
        </p>
        <p>
            British society today, and economically developed societies more generally, hardly face the same level of existential <br id="br">
            threats. And yet, Britain has kept its old monarchical system. In fact, it is the only Western country not to have <br id="br">
            changed its constitution in the last three hundred or so years (effectively since Cromwell’s Protectorate in the <br id="br">
            1650s). And while some countries were founded on a rejection of such a system, their constitutions came to emulate <br id="br">
            that same monarchical structure: for instance, the US was founded on the back of a revolution against the tyranny <br id="br">
            of the British monarchy, yet the office of President was made to look like that of the king – in fact, Alexander <br id="br">
            Hamilton advocated for the creation of an English-style monarchy, and George Washington could have delivered on <br id="br">
            that intention as President if he hadn’t given up the office after two terms. Moreover, political rituals in <br id="br">
            countries, which have shed their monarchies, often, still contain the same pomp and circumstance that would <br id="br">
            characterise a traditional monarchy. All this is not said to disparage these countries that no longer have kings <br id="br">
            or queens, or to expose them as hypocrites. It is instead an observation of the reality of the world as God created <br id="br">
            it, whereby societies need a symbolic entity at the top, lest they crumble to the ground. 
        </p>
            <h2 style="font-size: medium; font-family: century schoolbook; text-align: left;"><u><b>Hierarchy of values</u></b></h2>
        <p>
            The first reason for this is that a country needs a hierarchy of values. Like individuals, collectives must <br id="br">
            judge and measure choices and decisions according to the principles which they have set out as worthy of <br id="br">
            aspiration. These principles may evolve over time, and individuals may disagree with them, but they form the <br id="br">
            fundamentals of what unifies the collective and what keeps it stable, thereby ensuring the ‘psychological health’, <br id="br">
            of the group. But for a hierarchy of values to exist psychologically or symbolically, it must at least partly exist <br id="br">
            in the society, such that improvement in the social hierarchy may be realised by adherence to these societal <br id="br">
            values. Take hard work for example, a value that characterises many societies. For it to be recognised as valuable, <br id="br">
            it must be emulated and embodied within the actual social hierarchy, such that hard-working behaviour is conducive <br id="br">
            to an improvement in societal status. This will never be perfectly the case, there will always be unfairness and <br id="br">
            cheating, but fundamentally, a society relies on the existence of a hierarchy indicating that there is something <br id="br">
            of value worth striving for. Flatten out the hierarchy, as many egalitarians have tried to do, and you eliminate <br id="br">
            that distinction between what is good and encouraged by the society and what is not, because no behaviour leads to <br id="br">
            advancement in the real world. It is effectively declaring that there is nothing of value, except equality, which <br id="br">
            necessitates the individual’s potential and initiative to be stymied. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Societies generally seem to have grasped the value of hierarchy, not least of them Britain. Its principles, values <br id="br">
            and ideals, developed over many centuries, are enshrined at the top, represented by the monarch. Many of the ideas <br id="br">
            which emerged out of the British tradition are now seen as universal: ideas of freedom, rights, and equality before <br id="br">
            the law, which are now proclaimed as human rights by institutions like the UN are in truth derived in great part <br id="br">
            from the Christian tradition, as it was formed in the conflicts, debates and practices that characterised British <br id="br">
            history. In fact, as early as 1470, Sir John Fortescue was writing about the rights and privileges of Englishmen <br id="br">
            in his Commendation of the Laws of England, commenting on how even the king could not trespass on someone’s property <br id="br">
            without their permission. These values, along with others that are more unique to Britain, are all kept alive by <br id="br">
            the fact that they are grounded in custom and tradition, both of which are represented by that constant presence <br id="br">
            at the top of the hierarchy. It is key to Britain that there be two heads of state: one that changes according to <br id="br">
            the public whims or the common zeitgeist, and another that remains above that, representing the timeless values <br id="br">
            that characterise our country, and it is important that the two should not be confused. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This does not mean that these values are created at the top. As Christians, we believe that God is the source of all <br id="br">
            that is good and true, and that He is the ultimate point towards which all good hierarchies point: He is the ‘King of Kings’.<br id="br">
             This concept is well represented by the symbol of the great pyramid, as found on the back of the US dollar bill. <br id="br">
             The idea is that the entity at the top is simultaneously an embodiment of all that the hierarchy aspires to and is <br id="br">
             separate from the hierarchy. In this way, we do not believe that the monarch is God, but that he or she is at the <br id="br">
             top of the social structure, while still subject to God and equal to all in the eyes of God, who is above all. <br id="br">
             Symbolically, this is what the cross on the top of monarchs’ crown is meant to be a reminder of: that the monarch <br id="br">
             has God’s blessing or that God’s hand lays on their head, like the Jewish yarmulke, but also that God is above them.<br id="br">
            Moreover, part of the monarch’s role is to stand as a pointer towards God, both by virtue of his or her character <br id="br">
            and by virtue of the nature of his or her office. 
          
        </p>
            <h2 style="font-size: medium; font-family: century schoolbook; text-align: left;"><u><b>Monarchy and implied meaning</u></b></h2>
        <p>
            Small ‘r’ republicans would debate the need for a monarch to fill those functions, arguing instead for a more fluid <br id="br">
            and fair hierarchy with a deserving entity at the top. After all, shouldn’t the people at the top earn their way <br id="br">
            there? This is a fair and understandable point, which aims at letting the most competent people achieve higher status. <br id="br">
            I would also be remiss if I didn’t say that republics can function very well and have been a good medium for spreading <br id="br">
            freedom and equality throughout the world. In fact, since the foundation of the United States, republics have been <br id="br">
            the standard that all new states aspire to, such that even regimes like the USSR and North Korea call themselves <br id="br">
            republics to legitimise themselves. Nor am I advocating for republics to revert to monarchy; I think that if it <br id="br">
            not undergirded by history and tradition, a monarchy would not last long. But I think that monarchy fits in better <br id="br">
            with a Christian view of the world, for a couple of reasons. 
        </p>
        <p>
            To begin, human beings need to be reminded that they do not create everything. The central idea of a republic is <br id="br">
            that the people have raised an individual to the heights of power by their own will and strength, and accordingly <br id="br">
            may tear him down if they so desire. This is consubstantial with the idea that any legitimate authority must spring <br id="br">
            from below, from the people, and may never be ordained by something higher. The problem with this is firstly that it <br id="br">
            is a recipe for instability, since the people can easily claim that they are not satisfied with the system that they <br id="br">
            have inherited and thus it loses all legitimacy in their eyes. One must only look at the writings of republicans like <br id="br">
            Thomas Jefferson to see this manifest: for instance, he writes that the constitution should be completely revised, <br id="br">
            tabula rasa, at every generational milestone, meaning every twenty years or so, so that the people aren’t ruled by <br id="br">
            the ideas of their ancestors. To say that any legitimate authority must come from the people is tantamount to saying <br id="br">
            that anything that gets in the way of the people is illegitimate and must be destroyed – it is no wonder that republics <br id="br">
            often appear on the back of bloody revolutions. Another problem is that the idea of the general will is often difficult <br id="br">
            to define, and can often turn into either the tyranny of an individual who claims to embody the general will, or the <br id="br">
            tyranny of the majority.
        </p>
        <p>
            But on a more profound level, this vision poses a problem to a Christian way of life because it is fundamentally a <br id="br">
            prideful attitude. Indeed, the idea that we create our own systems ourselves, that there is no framework that is inherited <br id="br">
            from God or from our ancestors who were God-believers, can quickly translate into the Nietzschean idea that we can create <br id="br">
            our own values. This, after all, is the central idea of the story of the tower of Babel: humans want to reach the <br id="br">
            heavens – a utopian aspiration – and to do so must build their own ethical framework. But as they try to reshape moral <br id="br">
            reality, actual reality, portrayed as God because He is its creator, comes to foil their plans. A more humble attitude <br id="br">
            is to see the world as a prolonged covenant between God and His people passed on from one generation to the next. This <br id="br">
            idea underlies Burke’s conception of society: for him, society is a contract between past, present and future generations, <br id="br">
            whereby we inherit certain systems, and we must try to preserve what is good within them so that we may pass them on to <br id="br">
            the next generation. God is central to this view because He is meant to be the guiding hand as society progresses and <br id="br">
            develops, such that it may be gradually shaped by His Divine Law. In this way, human beings do have natural rights <br id="br">
            bestowed unto them by God and thus preceding society, but these natural rights cannot be understood by pure reason, <br id="br">
            having instead to be discovered through human custom conforming to divine intent. Having a monarchy like Britain’s, <br id="br">
            sustains that continuity which binds one generation to the next and represents the timeless values, which call society <br id="br">
            towards perfection, towards God. In this way, that there are certain things which are beyond our control and that are <br id="br">
            greater than us is a reminder of the humility with which we should approach the world as we understand it, and it <br id="br">
            grounds us in reality because it establishes a basic value system inherited from people who were themselves grounded <br id="br">
            in reality, which should consequently not be recklessly tampered with.

            Finally, monarchy by nature tends towards the religious because it is a reminder of the immaterial realm of meaning <br id="br">
            that undergirds and brings life to the physical world. Indeed, the idea that an individual can embody the nation is a <br id="br">
            rebuke to the rationalistic view that matter is the only valid level of analysis through which to understand the world. <br id="br">
            When atheist thinkers try to apply the same logic and method as the material world requires to religion, arguing that <br id="br">
            the scientific method does not prove God, they often display a misunderstanding of the fundamental religious belief in <br id="br">
            a spiritual realm, existing in consonance with the physical realm. As religious people, we believe that the self is a <br id="br">
            physical being, but we believe that this physical embodiment of the self is a reflection, a symbol, of the spiritual idea <br id="br">
            of the self. To put this in a clearer sense, an action from a scientific standpoint is just an interplay between parts <br id="br">
            of matter, but we believe that this interplay of matter has some sort of meaning attached to it: the actions of giving <br id="br">
            bread to a starving child on one side and taking it away from him on the other, may seem the same to a scientific <br id="br">
            rationalist but we associate different meanings to them – the former represents something good while the latter does <br id="br">
            not. Thus, we attribute specific meaning to certain physical realities, and it is thereby possible for a physical <br id="br">
            reality to represent or embody a certain principle. All this is to say that a system of monarchy like Britain’s, <br id="br">
            understands that political power is not threefold but fourfold: there are those powers that Montesquieu <br id="br">
            identified - executive, legislative and judicial – but there is also the symbolic, which is often confused with <br id="br">
            the executive, with often dangerous and divisive consequences. And it is this last form of power that the monarch <br id="br">
            holds by representing and thus embodying the nation. Through this example we understand that we are not limited to <br id="br">
            our fleshly existence but we are called to incarnate a metaphysical or immaterial principle like truth, beauty, <br id="br">
            endurance or gentleness, the same way Christ incarnated the all-encompassing principle which we can only express <br id="br">
            using words like God, the Logos, Being itself.
