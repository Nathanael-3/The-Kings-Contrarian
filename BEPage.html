        <h2 style="font-size: medium; font-family: century schoolbook;"><u><b>Huaweiâ€™s Technological leap with the Mate 60 Pro</u></b></h2>
        Huawei, a leading mobile phone brand from China, recently showcased its advanced Mate 60 Pro. The global tech <br id="br">
        community was taken aback to discover that this device is driven by a 7-nanometre (nm) processor. This revelation <br id="br">
        has ignited discussions about the true current impact of U.S. sanctions on Chinese advanced semiconductor technology <br id="br">
        and how effectively Beijing has managed to navigate around these restrictions. <br id="br">
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            The 7nm chip, which powers the Mate 60 Pro, is the brainchild of the Shanghai-based Semiconductor <br id="br">
            Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC). This achievement is a testament to China's evolving prowess <br id="br">
            in the semiconductor domain. Before this innovation, the prevailing assumption, especially considering <br id="br">
            the Western sanctions, was that China's technological ceiling was capped at producing 14nm chips. <br id="br">
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            <h2 style="font-size: medium; font-family: century schoolbook;"><u><b>Understanding the significance of Nanometre Node</u></b></h2>
            In the realm of chip manufacturing, the term 'nanometre node' is pivotal. It essentially denotes the <br id="br">
            generation or the technological advancement of the chip. A smaller nm number signifies a more advanced <br id="br">
            and efficient chip.
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            For a historical perspective, chips designed at the 14nm specification made their debut in smartphones <br id="br">
            around the mid-2010s. By today's standards, these chips are lagging by two to three generations. Drawing <br id="br">
            a comparison, a basic model like the Samsung A20 operates on a 14nm chipset. Currently, the pinnacle of <br id="br">
            chip technology hovers around 3nm, predominantly used in high-end smartphones with the only recipient <br id="br">
            of this technology being Apple with its home grown A17 Bionic Chip. On the other hand, older and more <br id="br">
            established semiconductor chips, which are around 28nm or even larger, find their applications in vehicles <br id="br">
            and common household gadgets. Smaller Nanometre chips are required for sophisticated technologies, <br id="br">
            predominantly in AI and 5G.
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            SMIC was only able to mass-produce 14nm chips up until 2022, which, when juxtaposed with global semiconductor <br id="br">
            giants Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), who were <br id="br">
            producing 7nm chips in 2017, is rather poor. This rapid progression by Huawei and SMIC underscores China's <br id="br">
            accelerated efforts to bridge the technological divide.
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            Dr. Mark Liu, Chairman of TSMC, highlighted the 7nm process as a significant leap and a defining moment in <br id="br">
            semiconductor production for the Chinese. The primary distinction between the 7nm and 14nm processes lies <br id="br">
            in the substantial increase in the number of transistors per unit area for the 7nm process, coupled with a <br id="br">
            marked reduction in energy consumption. This results in 7nm chips being not only more potent than their 14nm <br id="br">
            counterparts but also more cost-efficient. For instance, in 2020, the production cost of a 7nm chip stood at <br id="br">
            $233. This was not only more economical than the $331 required for a 16nm chip but also surpassed the $238 <br id="br">
            cost of a 5nm chip. Furthermore, NVIDIA's A100 Tensor Core data-centre processor, built using TSMC's 7nm process, <br id="br">
            witnessed a twenty-fold performance enhancement. This optimization meant that a data centre, which previously <br id="br">
            necessitated 25 storage racks, could be condensed to just one.
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            To summarise, 7nm chips offer dual advantages: they reduce ownership costs while simultaneously boosting <br id="br">
            computational capabilities. This makes them a financially sound choice for applications in AI, cloud <br id="br">
            computing, and 5G, spanning both commercial and defence sectors.
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            <h2 style="font-size: medium; font-family: century schoolbook;"><u><b>Reassessing the Impact of U.S. Sanctions</u></b></h2>
            While Huawei's advancements are undeniably commendable, it's essential to evaluate the broader picture. <br id="br">
            The U.S. sanctions, aimed at curbing China's tech growth, have left tangible dents. Huawei's financials <br id="br">
            bear testimony to this. In 2022, their revenue clocked 642 billion yuan (equivalent to US$87.4 billion). <br id="br">
            While this might seem impressive, it's a mere shadow of their 2020 revenue, which stood at a whopping <br id="br">
            891 billion yuan. Their operating profit too witnessed a slump, hitting a five-year low. While Huawei's <br id="br">
            7nm chip is a product of extant technology, their journey towards the next big innovation might be riddled <br id="br">
            with challenges, especially without unhindered access to cutting-edge chipmaking technology.
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            While profits have taken a hit, does it necessarily matter to a company that, in essence, has unlimited <br id="br">
            financial and political backing from the CCP, due to its importance for national security and potential <br id="br">
            political implications through being a world leader in technological advancement? 
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            <h2 style="font-size: medium; font-family: century schoolbook;"><u><b>China's Pursuit of Semiconductor Autonomy</u></b></h2>
            China's domestic chip production remains limited despite being a significant consumer of the aforementioned. <br id="br">
            In 2021, the nation's semiconductor market was valued at approximately $186.5 billion. However, only chips <br id="br">
            worth $31.2 billion were produced domestically, resulting in a self-sufficiency rate of 16.7%. Notably, <br id="br">
            chips produced by China-based companies constituted just 6.6% of the domestic consumption, valued at <br id="br">
            $12.3 billion.
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            The "Made in China 2025" strategy aims for a 75% self-sufficiency rate by 2030. Given this target, China's <br id="br">
            substantial subsidies and policy incentives for semiconductor companies are understandable. Despite some <br id="br">
            notable failures in semiconductor development, China remains steadfast in its commitment to bolstering its <br id="br">
            semiconductor industry.
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            <h2 style="font-size: medium; font-family: century schoolbook;"><u><b>Limited Progress</u></b></h2>
            Previously, SMIC's most advanced known chip was the 14nm, as Washington's restrictions in late 2020 prevented  <br id="br">
            it from acquiring an EUV (used to print the tiny features that make up a microchip) machine from the Dutch  <br id="br">
            company, ASML. However, according to TechInsights, it seems SMIC might have achieved the production of 7nm chips  <br id="br">
            by adapting the more basic DUV (same as EUV but less powerful), which they could still acquire from ASML without  <br id="br">
            restrictions.
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            Regardless of the chip's manufacturer, Tilly Zhang, an analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics, minimized the achievement. <br id="br">
            She pointed to a low yield rate, which decreases the number of functional chips extracted from each wafer, <br id="br">
            thereby increasing costs. Additionally, new export controls from the Netherlands will further restrict SMIC's <br id="br">
            ability to access advanced immersion DUV machines. Zhang commented, "The only reason Huawei can afford to sell <br id="br">
            phones with these chips at standard market prices is due to its vast financial resources combined with substantial <br id="br">
            government subsidies."
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            Recent reports from Reuters indicate that China plans to introduce a new state-supported investment fund targeting <br id="br"> 
            approximately $40 billion for its semiconductor sector, intensifying its efforts to level with the U.S. and other <br id="br">
            competitors. These subsidies are of the utmost importance as the Chinese chip industry depends on them for their <br id="br">
            survival and ability to compete, as some research entities predict that SMIC's 7nm process might have a yield rate <br id="br">
            below 50%, in contrast to the industry standard of 90% or higher. Doug Fuller, a semiconductor researcher at the <br id="br">
            Copenhagen Business School, remarked "The U.S. restrictions have significantly increased the costs of producing <br id="br">
            controlled technologies in China," suggesting that the Chinese government is likely bearing these expenses. <br id="br">
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            <h2 style="font-size: medium; font-family: century schoolbook;"><u><b>The Complex Web of the Tech Ecosystem</u></b></h2>
            The semiconductor landscape isn't just about individual companies or nations; it's a complex web of collaborations, <br id="br">
            partnerships, and shared innovations. The U.S. CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 adds another layer of complexity. <br id="br">
            This act essentially bars beneficiaries of a massive US$52.7 billion incentive program from entering any form <br id="br">
            of collaborative research or tech licensing with Chinese entities, especially if it pertains to high-tech <br id="br">
            semiconductors.
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            This poses significant challenges, especially considering the intricate nature of the semiconductor industry. <br id="br">
            A case in point is the outsourced assembly, testing, and packaging (OSAT) process. Samsung offers a vivid analogy,<br id="br"> 
            likening the semiconductor to the human brain, with its packaging representing the intricate nervous system and <br id="br">
            skeletal structure. The final phase, known as the package test, is a rigorous quality check ensuring the chip's <br id="br">
            optimal performance.
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            Collaborating with Chinese firms in this intricate domain could potentially jeopardize a company's future <br id="br">
            collaborations and access to U.S. technological innovations. Moreover, the U.S.'s deficiency in domestic <br id="br">
            OSAT capabilities might introduce unforeseen security vulnerabilities. Hence Samsung has limited and, in <br id="br">
            some cases, stopped selling advanced chip equipment to their Chinese counterparts to avoid the ire of the <br id="br">
            Americans.
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            <h2 style="font-size: medium; font-family: century schoolbook;"><u><b>Chinaâ€™s Counter strategy: Techno-Nationalism</u></b></h2>
            China, fully aware of the U.S.'s aggressive tech-driven strategies, has adopted a robust counterstrategy.  <br id="br">
            They are rallying their entire societal fabric against what they perceive as foreign adversaries aiming  <br id="br">
            to stifle their growth. This sentiment was echoed by China's Ministry of State Security, which recently  <br id="br">
            issued warnings against potential espionage threats and urged collective vigilance.
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            This narrative extends seamlessly into the tech domain. The underlying message is clear: Western powers <br id="br">
            are attempting to suppress China's technological ascent, and it's the patriotic duty of every Chinese <br id="br">
            citizen to thwart these efforts.
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            In line with this, a Reuters report highlighted China's rejuvenated efforts under its Thousand Talents Plan. <br id="br">
            This initiative aims to attract global tech experts, offering them lucrative incentives, all in a bid to <br id="br">
            bolster China's tech capabilities and navigate the maze of U.S. restrictions.

        <p id="article">
            <h2 style="font-size: medium; font-family: century schoolbook;"><u><b>Strategic Implications for the Semiconductor Industry</u></b></h2>
            Historical trends in China's electronics sector have informed policymakers that, despite current technological <br id="br">
            and production scale gaps with international counterparts, there are strategic advantages to supporting domestic <br id="br">
            semiconductor companies. Firstly, a surge in Chinese manufacturers can potentially saturate the market, <br id="br">
            limiting opportunities for second and third-tier wafer foundries. Projections suggest that by 2024, China <br id="br">
            will lead global chip factory construction, with 31 new facilities, surpassing Taiwan's 19, and the U.S.'s 12. <br id="br">
            While these new factories will primarily focus on established process nodes, this strategy could pressure other <br id="br">
            manufacturers specializing in these processes.
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            Secondly, if select Chinese companies excel amidst the policy-supported foundries, they could potentially  <br id="br">
            challenge or even lead the advanced process market. This model has been successful in sectors like PC/laptop  <br id="br">
            manufacturing with Lenovo and telecommunications with Huawei and ZTE. SMIC, with its advancements in the 7nm  <br id="br">
            process, exemplifies a Chinese firm poised to challenge international semiconductor leaders and potentially  <br id="br">
            bypass U.S. technological constraints.
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            <h2 style="font-size: medium; font-family: century schoolbook;"><u><b>China's Technological Aspirations and Implications</u></b></h2>
            Historically, U.S. sanctions restricted Chinese chip designers from leveraging TSMC's advanced processes.  <br id="br">
            If SMIC's 7nm process becomes widely adopted by other Chinese manufacturers, it could catalyse China's  <br id="br">
            progress in areas like AI, high-speed computing, and 5G. This progression aligns with China's vision of  <br id="br">
            transitioning from a manufacturing behemoth to a global manufacturing powerhouse.
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            While specifics about SMIC's 7nm shipments remain undisclosed, advancements in this domain could propel <br id="br">
            China's innovations in AI and high-speed computing. Such progress could enhance China's economic and defence <br id="br">
            capabilities, posing challenges for Taiwan and the broader East Asian region.
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            China's modernization goals, set for the People's Liberation Army's centennial in 2027, emphasize <br id="br">
            advancements in AI, quantum computing, and hypersonic, all of which necessitate advanced chips. Merely <br id="br">

            could bolster its military capabilities.

            The U.S. is currently lobbying Japan and the Netherlands to expand the existing EUV embargo to encompass  <br id="br">
            DUV machines. While some argue that isolating China might hasten its path to self-sufficiency, historical  <br id="br">
            patterns suggest China's ambitions won't wane until it achieves market dominance. Hence, merely restricting  <br id="br">
            China's access to EUV machines might not effectively prevent its advancements in cutting-edge technology  <br id="br">
            nodes below 10nm.

            Predicting the trajectory of China's semiconductor sector is akin to gazing into a crystal ball. While financial <br id="br">
            prowess is a significant asset, the broader chipmaking ecosystem demands a blend of individual creativity, <br id="br">
            innovation, and an environment fostering free expression. These attributes are often synonymous with <br id="br">
            democratic setups.

        <p id="article">
            To provide some context, the 2022 Bloomberg Innovative Index ranked the top 10 most innovative countries,  <br id="br">
            all of which are democracies. In the Asian context, South Korea and Singapore lead the pack, ranking sixth  <br id="br">
            and seventh respectively. China, despite its massive strides, ranks 11th globally and third in Asia.

            While China has been a global frontrunner in patent submissions since 2011, the challenge lies in converting <br id="br">
            volume to value and ensuring global applicability and acceptance of these patents.

        <p id="article">
            While the success China achieves in the semiconductor industry can be anyoneâ€™s guess due to external and internal <br id="br">
            factors, what can be a certainty is that the once prosperous world of collaboration, encouraged by all the developed <br id="br">
            nations is slowly coming to an end, being instead replaced by protectionism and bipolarity akin to the cold war, <br id="br">
            except this time the nations with the preponderance of power are the U.S.A. and China.
