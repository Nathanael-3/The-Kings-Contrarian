        <b>US Capitol building with dollar bills in the background</b>
        </p>
        <p id="author">
            <b>By: Colin Yin | Harvard University</b>
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            National debts are rising worldwide with many of the largest economies having debts in excess of 100% of gross <br id="br">
            domestic product (GDP). Japan for example has a debt-to-GDP ratio of 263%, whilst the US is at 123%. National <br id="br">
            debt is defined as the total sum of money that the government owes countries, companies, and individuals that <br id="br">
            it has decided to borrow money from. Once this national debt exceeds GDP like in the two examples previously <br id="br">
            given, a country finds itself in a situation where it owes more in debt than it makes in income. In fact, <br id="br">
            debts like this are incredibly hard to pay off as they require either astronomically high taxes, which would <br id="br">
            drive down GDP as businesses and individuals leave your nation, or consistent fiscal surpluses, which would <br id="br">
            see massive cuts to state spending, a measure that is largely political suicide. 
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            Furthermore, the situation of large debts is set to continue as the Congressional Budget Office predicts that <br id="br">
            US national debt will reach 195% of GDP in 2053. Whilst for the UK the Office for Budget Responsibility predicts <br id="br">
            a national debt around 300% of GDP by 2070. Astronomically high debts like these will have severe consequences <br id="br">
            for the economic and political health of these nations and the international system writ large. 
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            As populations across the globe demand ever further increases in government spending on welfare, the military, <br id="br">
            and infrastructure, the government must find the money from somewhere in order to fund these programs. This money <br id="br">
            can be raised in two ways, through high levels of taxation or through borrowing money or what usually is the case <br id="br">
            a combination of the two. However, as governments have continued to borrow money especially during the Covid-19 <br id="br">
            pandemic, interest payments on debt as a percentage of government expenditure continues to rise. This further <br id="br">
            reduces the amount of money that governments have to spend, as larger and larger amounts of tax revenue are set <br id="br">
            aside to solely pay off debt, requiring an increasing reliance on borrowing to fund state programs fuelling a <br id="br">
            cycle of even more debt. 
            
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            This current situation seems to have no end, as Congress just recently raised the debt ceiling for the 78th time <br id="br">
            since 1960, at the risk of a government default if they hadn’t. This is not a sustainable solution and one that <br id="br">
            makes me question whether there is any point to having a debt ceiling if it just continues to get raised. Yet, <br id="br">
            both Republicans and Democrats seem to not have the political gusto to actually address this issue in any meaningful <br id="br">
            way, with former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan’s social security spending cuts plan, being lambasted by former <br id="br">
            President Donald Trump and the majority of the Republican base as one example.
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            Yet, if no solution is brought forward, the US risks its place as the current global hegemon. An increased reliance <br id="br">
            on borrowing decreases the reliability of a repayment on this debt. Much like if you were to borrow money and never <br id="br">
             pay it back, lenders would be far less likely to lend you money in future. The same can be said with national debt. <br id="br">
             Whilst currently the US is in a more fortunate position than most, being the global hegemon and having the global <br id="br">
             reserve currency, providing it with more leeway over its debt levels because the international system relies on the <br id="br">
             health of the US government and its legal tender. However, if the US debt continues to spiral out of control the trust <br id="br">
             that is required in the US for the dollar to be the global reserve currency will slowly slip away, being replaced <br id="br">
             potentially by gold, the euro, the renminbi or another form of currency. This could be made even worse if the financials <br id="br">
             of the US government make it such, that heavy cuts have to be made to the US military, decreasing the US’s ability to <br id="br">
             take on the role as global hegemon. 
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            In desperate times, governments may have to fall back on money creation in order to pay off this debt. Money creation <br id="br">
            involves the printing of money by central banks in order to increase the money supply and incentivise consumption, <br id="br">
            as well as to pay off debts. Yet, when the money supply expands, intended to pay off government debt, this causes an <br id="br">
            upward inflationary effect driving up the prices of goods and services. This also inadvertently collapses trust in <br id="br">
            government bonds, as inflation causes them to lose their value, preventing the government from selling additional <br id="br">
            debt to finance state spending. However, most worryingly is that this policy doesn’t even have to be enacted for the <br id="br">
            consequences to appear. 
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            If those that hold the dollar suspect that the US will have to, or could potentially, use money creation to pay off <br id="br">
            debt they may well begin to sell their holdings of dollars, predicting potential inflation and currency depreciation. <br id="br">
            This could create a run on the dollar resulting in stagflation similar to the situation faced under Nixon in the 1970s. <br id="br">
            Stagflation is a situation in which high inflation is accompanied by stagnant growth and high unemployment. 
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            A run on the dollar would reduce the pounds buying power and make imports more expensive, which, given the US is an <br id="br">
            import oriented economy, particularly with regards to goods, higher import costs mean inflation rises.  
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            As inflation rises, so do interest rates and as a result consumption is disincentivised. This means companies are <br id="br">
            less able to sell goods and services, hampering economic growth. Lastly, as economic growth stagnates, firm’s profit <br id="br">
             margins will decrease, due to lower demand and as a result firms will begin to lay off workers to keep prices low, <br id="br">
             with the aim of increasing demand, resulting in stagflation. 
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            Therefore if the government decides the way forward with regards to paying off debt is to print money, the potential <br id="br">
            for high inflation becomes very real. Yet, even more worryingly is the fact that money does not even have to printed <br id="br">
            for there to be a run on the dollar and resulting stagflation, if the options open to the US government to pay off <br id="br">
            debt shrinks to solely money creation. 
        </p>  
        <p id="article">
            Instead, the US has some options to reverse this doom and gloom. A key solution would be to cut state spending heavily, <br id="br">
            whereby the US government runs a fiscal surplus every year. The current US deficit stands at $1.5 trillion, which is <br id="br">
            larger than the Spanish economy and to reverse, would require a mix of cuts in state spending and higher tax revenue <br id="br">
            over a long period of time, coupled with improving economic growth and productivity gains. Unfortunately, the latter <br id="br">
            are hard to achieve and the former are politically unpopular. That being said President Jackson was able to pay off <br id="br">
            government debt and President Coolidge came as close as any modern president to doing so, cutting national debt by 23% <br id="br">
            in six years. These solutions require action now but the current US political situation is apathetical to these <br id="br">
            propositions. Maybe, as Warren Buffet argued, the best way to reduce the government deficit and reduce national debt <br id="br">
            as a result, is to pass a law that states, if there is a deficit that year of over 3% of GDP, then all sitting members <br id="br">
            of congress are ineligible for re-election. That would establish the right incentives.
