        <b>The ancient Greek mathematician Euclid as depicted in Raphael's School of Athens</b>
        </p>
        <p id="author">
            <b>By: Marcus Johansson  | The University of Texas at Austin</b>
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            College is about the application of knowledge in the pursuit of truth. Yet, this mission has largely <br id="br">
            gone astray from campuses across America, as college becomes increasingly about credentials, politics, <br id="br">
            and incessant specialisation. Our Founding Founders were not interested in having expertise in one <br id="br">
            narrow field, but wanted to try their hand at politics, law, philosophy, architecture, engineering, <br id="br">
            and the natural sciences. However, to try their hand at so many disparate subjects they required a <br id="br">
            strong foundation in how to attain and apply knowledge across disciplines. We called these types of <br id="br">
            people Renaissance men. Unfortunately, they have come to be a rather endangered species.
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            I propose a new academic degree, devoted to the concept of attaining and applying knowledge across <br id="br">
            disciplines, and providing young people with the best possible tools to understand how to think. <br id="br">
            This academic degree would be three pronged, much like the famous Philosophy, Politics and Economics <br id="br">
            course at the University of Oxford. Instead, it would be Mathematics, Philosophy and History, <br id="br">
            establishing a degree that encapsulates analytical, theoretical, and empirical ways of thinking. <br id="br">
            I believe that these three subjects are integral to technological innovation and the creation of a <br id="br">
            free and prosperous society.
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            Yet, the number of young people interested in any of these three subjects is tragically low. <br id="br">
            Mathematics is the 26th most popular major in the US, philosophy is the 56th, and history is 15th. <br id="br">
            In fact, when asking my peers about mathematics, philosophy, and history, most of them say these <br id="br">
            subjects are useless and donâ€™t teach any practical skills, like business or law do. However, my <br id="br">
            response is always to illustrate that our laws come from philosophical ideas and historical context <br id="br">
            and our business strategies are filled with mathematical formulas, rooted in philosophical and <br id="br">
            historical observations about human nature. AI for example, is a practical piece of technology but <br id="br">
            its societal implications are rooted in philosophy.
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            Mathematics is the study of numbers, utilised in formulas to help explain the physical realities <br id="br">
            around us. Philosophy builds on this foundation to theorise about the purpose of these physical <br id="br">
            realities, and history provides us with the case studies for these philosophical ideals. When <br id="br">
            thought of in this way, the trio of disciplines becomes highly linked from one to the other, <br id="br">
            helping us to explain and better the physical realities that we are exposed to in our everyday <br id="br">
            lives as humans. 
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            Our progress has largely stagnated in recent years, particularly outside the world of bits. <br id="br">
            The world of atoms looks highly similar to what it would have looked like in the 1970s, and <br id="br">
            my theory for why we are so focused politically on cultural issues, is because of the intense <br id="br">
            level of stagnation that the US faces outside of this sphere. If we are to truly progress, not <br id="br">
            in the progressive sense, but in the technological and epistemological sense, we need theorisers, <br id="br">
            dreamers, and radicals and there is no better way to teach these characteristics than through <br id="br">
            mathematics, philosophy, and history.
