        <b>Russian President Vladimir Putin shaking hands with Kazkah President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev</b>

            <b>By: Nathanael Kennedy-Leroi | King's College London</b>
        </p>
        <div class="article">
        <p>
            Russian foreign policy traditions can be contextualized as a linear path from the material to the social <br id="br">
            and back to the material. It begins with the unique geographical implications that Russia faces, for example <br id="br">
            the size of the nation, the fact that it has very few paths to the ocean, its harsh conditions and most <br id="br">
            importantly for this article, its geographical weakness from the Ukrainian heartlands. This material geographic <br id="br">
            uniqueness creates a culture of constructivism that materializes in Russian exceptionalism. Rhetoric associated <br id="br">
            with Russia being destined to be a great power, harking back to its days of imperial expansion under the <br id="br">
            Russian Empire and the USSR, led by ‘great’ political leaders like Peter the Great and Joseph Stalin come from <br id="br">
            this geographic abnormality. This constructivist approach to foreign policy then influences the individual level <br id="br">
            of FPA, where the Russian people associate its great power with strong autocratic leaders governing the country. <br id="br">
            Despite years of persecution, famine, slavery and poverty, 51% of Russians still claim that they admire and like <br id="br">
            Joseph Stalin. The association between great power and a great leader has allowed Putin to cement his role as a <br id="br">
            dictator and to largely go unchallenged in his foreign policy prognosis. This focus on the individual level in <br id="br">
            Russia then ends up culminating in a realist foreign policy tradition. Its geography, that constructs a great <br id="br">
            power identity wielded by an autocrat means that Russia longs for a sphere of influence and remains constantly <br id="br">
            paranoid of foreign incursions. This paranoia makes Russia deeply suspicious of its neighbors and the <br id="br">
            international system at large, arguing that they are constantly duping the motherland. As Mearsheimer points <br id="br">
            out, this paranoia grows exponentially as NATO expands up to the Russian border. Russia thus sees itself as a <br id="br">
            lone wolf in the international system, therefore relying on power politics for its foreign policy <br id="br">
            decision-making. These sentiments culminate in Russia regularly showing its military might to its neighbors, <br id="br">
            Ukraine being the crescendo. 
        </p>
            <h2 style="font-size: medium; font-family: century schoolbook; text-align: left;"><u><b>Comparing The Broader Post-Soviet Space</u></b></h2>
        <p>
            Ex-Soviet nations have taken wildly disparate paths in their attitudes to Russia and the international system <br id="br">
            more broadly. The Baltic nations have opted for a primarily liberal approach to foreign policy, integrating <br id="br">
            into both NATO and the EU and aligning themselves with the West. Now all three are members of the Eurozone and <br id="br">
            have a strong democratic reputation. This group of nations represents one extreme, the other extreme are nations <br id="br">
            that remain strongly aligned to Russia, rejecting any Western cooperation and having strong Kremlin-aligned <br id="br">
            autocratic leaders. These nations include Belarus, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. These <br id="br">
            nations for the most part have operated within the realist framework, realizing that their best option, both <br id="br">
            for their leaders to stay in power and for the survival and health of their nations, is to align themselves <br id="br">
            very closely with Russia. These five nations are all run by individual dictators, thus the foreign policy <br id="br">
            decision-making is heavily linked to individual leaders, often acting out of the interest in the survival <br id="br">
            of their regimes. More middle of the road nations that have adopted an approach of, at times Russian <br id="br">
            alignment and at times Western alignment, include Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia and Azerbaijan. These nations <br id="br">
            have all sought closer relations with the West but have often been either enticed away by Russia or in the <br id="br">
            case of Ukraine and Georgia; military action has taken place. These nations have largely adopted a pragmatic <br id="br">
            alternating theoretical approach to foreign policy that can only be highlighted through a comparison between <br id="br">
            the various other post-Soviet space countries. These nations don’t adhere strictly to one theoretical <br id="br">
            approach. Yet, for this article I will aim to address the diverging stances taken by two of Russia’s closest <br id="br">
            allies, Kazakhstan and Belarus.
        </p>
            <h2 style="font-size: medium; font-family: century schoolbook; text-align: left;"><u><b>Kazakhstan</u></b></h2>
        <p>
            Kazakhstan is an oil rich Central Asian nation with a population of around 20 million people. It gained <br id="br">
            independence from the USSR in 1991 and has remained heavily aligned to Russia for much of its independent <br id="br">
            history. In fact, for much of this time it was widely considered as Russia’s second strongest ally after <br id="br">
            Belarus. It is a member of the CSTO, which is the Russian response to NATO, and its president Kassym-Jomart <br id="br">
            Tokayev was able to remain in power thanks to Russian backing after political turmoil. This stance however <br id="br">
            was not one of affinity for Russia but of political pragmatism. Russia had a regional hegemony over Central <br id="br">
            Asia, accounting for a huge amount of trade with Kazakhstan and for its political leaders as a way to <br id="br">
            maintain power. This for the time being meant it was in the interest for Kazakhstani leaders to remain on <br id="br">
            the side of Russia. Yet, after the invasion of Ukraine and since the rise of China, Kazakhstan has become <br id="br">
            somewhat opposed to Russia for the first time. Kazakhstan sees Russia as a declining world power and the <br id="br">
            former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev recently tweeted that Northern Kazakhstan was next in line for <br id="br">
            a Russian invasion after Ukraine. For Kazakhstan these are troubling developments that have led to the <br id="br">
            nation aligning with the West by sanctioning Russia, sending humanitarian aid to Ukraine and stating <br id="br">
            that they will refuse to recognize the Luhansk and Donetsk ‘self-proclaimed’ regions. This for such a <br id="br">
            strong Russian ally is a significant act of defiance. The reasoning behind such a move seems motivated <br id="br">
            purely out of self-interest and a sense of fear. Classical realism assumes that individuals primarily <br id="br">
            act out of fear or aggression and that this paradigm is then played out through domestic politics. It <br id="br">
            would be safe to assume that Kazakhstani leaders are fearful that military action will be carried out <br id="br">
            at their northern border, much like in Georgia and now Ukraine. The recent shift in attitude seems to <br id="br">
            indicate a feeling that Putin is acting in an increasingly irrational way, likely due to fear of the <br id="br">
            West, thus stoking up additional fear in the Kazakhstani leadership. The unprovoked invasion of Ukraine <br id="br">
            now calls into question the extent to which aligning oneself to Russia is beneficial for leadership <br id="br">
            survival on the individual level. Kazakhstan has furthermore utilized a situation where Russia is <br id="br">
            increasingly weak, to misalign itself. The leadership knows that Russia is highly unlikely to invade <br id="br">
            Kazakhstan at this moment in time, as it would mean that they would be fighting on two fronts thousands <br id="br">
            of kilometers’ apart. Thus, due to the issues Russia is currently facing from the invasion of Ukraine, <br id="br">
            Kazakhstan has been able to not only distance itself but also actively challenge its once greatest ally.
        </p>
            <h2 style="font-size: medium; font-family: century schoolbook; text-align: left;"><u><b>Belarus</u></b></h2>
        <p>
            Belarus on the other hand has had a drastically different approach, aligning itself even closer to Russia <br id="br">
            and letting Russia station troops in the nation to then invade Ukraine. Belarus is a mid sized Eastern <br id="br">
            European nation home to around 9 million people. It similarly gained independence from the USSR in 1991 <br id="br">
            and since 1994, has been governed by the Kremlin aligned Alexander Lukashenko, who recently began his <br id="br">
            sixth term as president. Belarus is widely considered Russia’s greatest ally, siding with the nation <br id="br">
            through thick and thin. Belarus has been sanctioned heavily alongside Russia after the invasion of Ukraine, <br id="br">
            causing it to only align itself even further. For Belarus, their expression of classical realism is very <br id="br">
            much the same as Kazakhstan but leads to different outcomes between the two nations. Classical realism’s <br id="br">
            focus on domestic politics and human nature is highly important for a nation who has had a single <br id="br">
            autocratic leader for all of its history. Lukashenko has built his political career around Soviet <br id="br">
            nostalgia, gets significant support from Putin in his election campaigns, and Belarus as a nation is <br id="br">
            highly dependent on trade and energy with Russia. For Lukashenko’s political survival, there is only one <br id="br">
            state that would allow autocracy in Europe and that is Russia. Lukashenko knows that if he wants to <br id="br">
            continue his political career and not be poisoned in the process, it is in his interest and because he <br id="br">
            represents Belarus as a whole, in its interest, to remain as aligned with Russia as possible. Furthermore, <br id="br">
            Belarus is on the border of Ukraine and already has Russian troops stationed within its territory, <br id="br">
            thus any provocation on the part of Belarus makes a Russian invasion against the nation far easier than <br id="br">
            a campaign against Kazakhstan, despite what Medvedev says. Since the invasion of Ukraine, Belarus has <br id="br">
            deepened its ties even further, recently signing an agreement to allow Russian nuclear weapons to be <br id="br">
            stationed in its territory. Similarly to Kazakhstan, these actions on the part of Belarus seem to be <br id="br">
            driven by fear, but unlike Kazakhstan this fear has led to even closer cooperation between Russia and <br id="br">
            Belarus. A key event in the international system i.e. the Russian invasion of Ukraine can lead to similar <br id="br">
            reactions in terms of fear between two Russian allies in Belarus and Kazakhstan and yet two polar <br id="br">
            opposite foreign policy responses. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has had significant implications for <br id="br">
            Belarus as a neighbor of both nations, creating a situation where either further Russian support or <br id="br">
            Russian defiance were potential options. Belarus opted for the former and has gone so far as to essentially <br id="br">
            surrender its territorial sovereignty to Russia, allowing it to station troops and nuclear missiles <br id="br">
            in the nation.
        </p>
            <h2 style="font-size: medium; font-family: century schoolbook; text-align: left;"><u><b>In Sum</u></b></h2>
        <p>
            Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the post-Soviet space has diverged markedly in highly interesting <br id="br">
            ways. Once Russia’s second greatest ally, Kazakhstan has decided to distance itself with its northern <br id="br">
            neighbour potentially realizing that the centre of power in Asia now lies in the hands of China. Belarus <br id="br">
            on the other hand decided that its best approach was further Russian alignment, most probably for reasons <br id="br">
            relating to Lukashenko’s political survival. Which strategy will play out the best? I will leave that to <br id="br">
            the fate of history.
