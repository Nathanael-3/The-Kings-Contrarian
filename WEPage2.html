        <b>A US and Chinese flag in front of a painting of the Great Wall of China</b>
        </p>
        <p id="author">
            <b>By: Jason Tu | University College London</b>
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            The US and China have a long and rich history that in recent years has meant an extraordinary amount of <br id="br">
            economic collaboration. However, both the US and China have turned towards protectionism as their <br id="br">
            relationship has tensed. In this short exposé, I will discuss the events leading up to the present situation <br id="br">
            and give my thoughts on the future outlook of US-China relations.
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            To understand why current geopolitical tensions are so high between these two economic powerhouses, we shall <br id="br">
            go back to 2018. The Trump Administration had implemented sweeping tariffs on over US$34 billion worth of <br id="br">
            Chinese goods, alongside other trade restrictions in the hopes of forcing China to make changes to what was <br id="br">
            deemed their unfair trade practices and intellectual property theft. This sparked a trade war, whereby <br id="br">
            China retaliated by placing their own respective tariffs on more than 500 US products. What resulted was <br id="br">
            the US being accused of “trade bullying” and China of “ripping off” Western countries. 
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            This trade war, partnered with the Covid-19 outbreak and China’s threats of a Taiwanese invasion, means <br id="br">
            that US-China relations have not been this tense since the end of the Cold War. To make matters worse, <br id="br">
            Biden recently met with Vietnam’s general secretary, Nguyen Phu Trong where the pair discussed the threat <br id="br">
            that China poses and a commitment to a historic US-Vietnam Comprehensive strategic partnership. Given the <br id="br">
            manufacturing threat that Vietnam poses for China due to its low labour and capital costs, China is likely <br id="br">
            to not take kindly to the US’s attempts to establish allies in the Sino sphere of influence. 
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            Furthermore, both sides are pursuing a more aggressive foreign policy in a time where the US’s relative <br id="br">
            global power is weakening and China’s export stability falling. Given the weakened position of both parties, <br id="br">
            the two nations are becoming increasingly paranoid, despite both sides making it apparent that geopolitical <br id="br">
            fallout serves neither of their interests. That being said, China’s Belt and Road Initiative and the US’s <br id="br">
            courting of allies across Asia, partnered with the increased economic warfare conducted by both sides, mean <br id="br">
            that US-China paranoia is anything but baseless. 
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            The Biden Administration has recently passed the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which focuses on providing US <br id="br">
            companies the ability to receive government subsidies, if their respective product and/or business model <br id="br">
            promotes a domestic green energy supply or green energy transition. This policy is a three-pronged act, <br id="br">
            aimed at reducing high levels of inflation, catalysing the shift away from fossil-fuel energy consumption, <br id="br">
            and fostering US-based technological advancement. Yet, this has not changed the global competitive landscape <br id="br">
            that the West faces, where China is also vying to be the tech capital of the world, with a particular focus <br id="br">
            on electric vehicle manufacturing. The many upcoming US startups such as SilaNano, who manufacture silicon <br id="br">
            anodes for electric vehicle batteries and QuantumScape, who are leaders in manufacturing solid-state batteries <br id="br">
            all face a common barrier to the green transition and that is China.
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            China currently leads the electric vehicle industry by possessing a huge market, unprecedented state subsidies <br id="br">
            and dominating supply chains over key materials such as lithium, graphite, and copper. Electric vehicle <br id="br">
            technology may have been conjured up in the West, but China moved and scaled up early to consolidate its <br id="br">
            leadership. According to Allied Market Research, the global electric vehicle industry was valued at $163.01 <br id="br">
            billion in 2020 and is projected to reach $823.75 billion by 2030, registering a compound annual growth rate of <br id="br">
            18.2%. With an astonishingly huge domestic market, the only way to outcompete China is to leapfrog their current <br id="br">
            technological prowess. This does not mean minor improvements on the lithium-ion battery but it means replacing <br id="br">
            this technology with state-of-the-art innovations.
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            China’s newfound role as a superpower has created a US response that is rather similar to that opted for by <br id="br">
            the Nixon Administration during the 1970s, as Japan began to rise economically. During that time, a trade war <br id="br">
            never led to any actual conflict and was unlikely to do so given Japan’s inability to have a large scale army or <br id="br">
            nuclear weapons capabilities, yet in the case of China the situation is radically different. A key reason why <br id="br">
            conflict between the two superpowers has remained solely economic thus far, has been the mutual economic <br id="br">
            interdependence between both nations that make any type of military conflict a costly endeavour that neither <br id="br">
            side would gain anything from. Yet, a return to a mercantilist economic approach that abandons free trade as <br id="br">
            opted for under both the Trump and Biden administrations, makes the economic upsides of military warfare <br id="br">
            potentially greater than its downsides. That being said, given both nations have nuclear weapons capabilities, <br id="br">
            the theory of mutually assured destruction makes potential military conflict largely off the table. As a <br id="br">
            result, officials on both sides have made it clear that a war is not what they want. 
        </p>
        <p id="article">
            The US and China need to implement policies that aim to reduce the current economic and geopolitical tensions  <br id="br">
            and focus on increased cooperation on pressing issues that are global in nature, such as AI and climate change.  <br id="br">
            Failure to do so on issues that drive their current confrontation will inevitably lead to collision. A war  <br id="br">
            between the world’s largest exporter and the world’s largest economy would be catastrophic and destabilize global  <br id="br">
            stability for years to come. A reversion back to the free-trade policies of old would be a welcome step away  <br id="br">
            from this hypothetical.
